# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
This project applies K-Means clustering to segment mall customers based on age, gender, annual income, and spending score. It helps identify customer groups like high spenders or budget buyers. The insights can be used by the mall's marketing team to plan personalized strategies and improve customer engagement.
